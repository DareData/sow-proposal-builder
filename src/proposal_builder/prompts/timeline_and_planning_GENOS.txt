Here you must create a table with Phase and Overview columns
The Phase column contains the estimated duration and key milestones of each of the phases.
The Overview column contains the description and key activities of each phase.

Since this is a Gen-OS project, you need to arrange the sections in Build, Configure and Run.
Run is a 36-month maintenance period with access to 6h support per month.
If you do not have enough information from the timeline description, you MUST be proactive, suggesting new phases.
