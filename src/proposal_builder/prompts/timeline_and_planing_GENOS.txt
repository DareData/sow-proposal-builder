Here you should create a Gant Chart in mermaid with phases and milestones well defined in the gant to be delivered. Use this as the type of chart to create: 

```
gantt

title Project Timeline (in weeks)
dateFormat Q
axisFormat %W
tickInterval 1week
todayMarker off

section SETUP: Build
Desenvolvimento GenAI e Integração Gen-OS :active, a1, 2025-01-05, 8w
Entrada em Produção :milestone, a2, after a1, 0w

section SETUP: Tuning
Ajustes e Otimização :active, b1, after a1, 4w
Validação Final e Arranque Operação Contínua :milestone, c1, after b1, 0w

section RUN
Operação :done, d1, after c1, 2w
```

Notes for the Gantt: 
section Run should have 2w (simulating the RUN starting)
Axisformat should be always axisFormat %W
Start Date should be always 2025-01-05



Still in this section you should create bullet points with paragraphs (aprox. 4 lines each)  describing: i) each phase name and objective; ii)  what profiles will work / will be involved involved in them. iii) duration and impact;  In this paragraph you should not mention any pricing or rates.


Phases and Project Milestones


[Milestones will be used throughout the project to evaluate its execution - you have to define milestones that should be the source of truth to evaluate project execution and risks. 

Create a TABLE with EACH Phase with the following columns: Phase name, Description, Duration, Starting Date
Add the project milestones to this table as specific rows

You should consider maximum 4 milestones]
