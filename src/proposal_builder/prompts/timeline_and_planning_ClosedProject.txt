Here you must create a table with Phase and Overview columns
The Phase column contains the duration and key milestones of each of the phases.
The Overview column contains the description and key activities of each phase.

Since this is a closed project, you MUST be very specific about deliverables: milestones and key activities.
If you do not have enough information from the timeline description, you MUST be proactive, suggesting new phases.
