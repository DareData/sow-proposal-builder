Create a table with Phase | Overview columns.

Phase column: Contains the duration and key milestones of each of the phases.

Example:
Problem Definition & Assessment
Duration: 2-3 weeks

Overview column: Contains the description and key activities of each phase. No bullet points - write as flowing prose
- Example: "During this phase we will engage with [client]'s IT and business teams in interviews and work sessions to redefine and adapt the proposed architecture. The activities will include mapping data sources, assessing available information, and defining model parameters. At the end of this phase, [client] should have a refined data architecture."

Since this is a closed project, be very specific about the deliverables: milestones and key activities.
