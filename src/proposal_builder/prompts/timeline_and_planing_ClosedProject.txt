Phases and Project Milestones


[Milestones will be used throughout the project to evaluate its execution - you have to define milestones that should be the source of truth to evaluate project execution and risks. 

Create a TABLE with EACH Phase with the following columns: Phase name, Description, Duration, Starting Date
Add the project milestones to this table as specific rows

You should consider maximum 4 milestones]

The section name should be Timeline & Planning or their translation into Portuguese and corresponds to section number 3.
