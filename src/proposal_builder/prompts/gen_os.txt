This is a description of Gen-OS capabilities. Use this in order to build the proposal.

A DEEP DIVE ON GEN-OS
TL; DR: DareData's Gen-OS is an optional platform that allows you to build, monitor and optimize agentic GenAI solutions fast with human-in-the-loop processes, billed monthly or yearly by use case with access to updates, fixes, new features and support. An equivalent MVP platform built in a Time & Materials regime would cost around 350k-400k€ plus maintenance and development costs. At the moment, we are building Gen-OS within NOS and CTT.

DareData's Gen-OS is a platform that allows you to quickly create, integrate and manage generative agents, and stands out for its technological independence and ability to adapt to the specific needs of each organisation.
Being agnostic with regard to operating systems and underlying infrastructures, Gen-OS avoids technological lock-ins and provides greater flexibility for companies that want to follow a ‘build’ approach to their own generative operating systems. The avoiding lock-in spirit is also built-in in the own Gen-OS, where your solutions can be easily decoupled from the system by simply commenting some lines of code. We want you to be happy about purchasing Gen-OS, not feeling like a hostage. 
At its core, the platform includes a robust system for monitoring, continuous optimisation and correction in operation, through Human-in-the-Loop processes. It makes it possible to achieve high levels of operational performance, especially in critical scenarios in which the combination of generative intelligence and human intervention is essential. This hybrid approach ensures not only speed of implementation, but also a continuous improvement in the quality of the responses generated, resulting in a significant competitive advantage over solutions that are not designed to scale or solve concrete problems of the complexity and size typical of real business needs.
It is especially suited to solving sales, customer support and back-office automation problems, where it has a wide variety of high-impact use cases.

Gen-OS was conceived as a tool for critical processes under the assumption that these were the really transforming Generative use cases, and here is where we have observed the largest ROIs. These are those that are fundamental for the Company to operate. In that sense, we need that 100% of the processes are taken care of. Our three main cycles solve this issue:
Operation Cycle: here is where humans enter in the loop, solving the cases where the AI did not produce a satisfactory result. This is where we guarantee that 100% of the operation is taken care of.
Optimization Cycle: we believe that production-level quality cannot be achieved in one sitting. What we believe in is a model in which we start with acceptable business metrics, solving a chunk of the problem. By creating mechanisms via Content or Development Issues, we use Gen-OS ticket management system to improve performance over time, achieving operational business service.
Analytics: even if we tune our system until getting enough quality, we still need to understand and monitor a long list of metrics: system performance, business performance, logging, etc. But this is not the only aspect… we also need to pay attention to performance drops in the system, since external changes can make our system fail over time. When this happens, we can go back to the Optimization cycle. 

We also have certain areas of future development that work in a complementary way to the main ideas:
Eval Sets and pre-deployment pipelines: we believe that the best way to determine a generative system’s performance is by comparing against a set of real selected cases. These work in the development phase as our ground truth for creating a working system and then work as tests in a pre-deployment pipeline whenever a change is incorporated into the system: new information, new code, new Agent, etc. By leveraging the Issue Management system, we can also continuously enlarge this set by including situations we want to guarantee in the future.
Knowledge Management: we believe that, in most cases, developers do not have the necessary business knowledge to decide over which content has to be incorporated (they only need to control the how). In that sense, we also have a knowledge management screen that allows non-technical users to perform CRUD operations on the Vector Database as intended by the developers. For more complex processes, we provide our Knowledge Management framework later on. 
Gen-OS as integrator: a critical aspect for Gen-OS is to easily allow the inclusion of pre-built Agents into the system with minimum development. In a way, we expect to have a similar model to MLFlow, where a couple lines of code are enough to integrate with the system, while removing those lines guarantees a smooth decoupling. As part of its roadmap, even though we first created Gen-OS to solve Enterprises’ problems that require building a custom system, future versions of Gen-OS are expected to integrate with most common Agent builders like LangFlow, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Google’s AgentSpace, Salesforce’s AgentForce, etc. 
A Cockpit for the Entire Operation: the idea of Gen-OS’ Control Room is to become a cockpit for different layers of the business operation. For example, consider Customer Service. We can have metrics on client satisfaction with our communication channels, number of interactions, tickets sold, etc. One layer below we can find specificities about our Generative Use Cases: Voice Chatbot, Chat Chatbot, Email Replier, etc. A final layer gives visibility over the system and component performance: Case resolved by Agents, number of interactions with OpenAI, delay time, etc.
