DareData's framework for Agentic solutions

You can MUST use the following information to generate a proposal

Before deep diving into the use cases themselves, we give an overview of the current agentic structure that we recommend when developing GenAI solutions, based on previous implementations in large Enterprises. This architecture is open to modifications during the assessment and development of the solutions.

We differentiate four main Agent Archetypes: Knowledge Specialist, API Specialist, Extractor and Orchestrator. The first three work as generative tools of an orchestrator archetype.
- The Orchestrators are the centerpieces of the solutions and their objective is to route the system to the proper agents and gather the necessary information to create answers, when needed. 
- The knowledge specialists are the agents responsible for a single domain business and have behind a controlled process of the ingestion of information. Therefore, it is composed not only of the prompts, but also the source of information and how it is partitioned. 
- The API specialists are agents that integrate a generative solution with systems that can be accessed via API or similar. These again are dedicated to a single business domain and can query one or more APIs/endpoints in real-time. 
- The Extractors, which are the main components of most of the proposed MVPs for this RFP, are generative systems that leverage OCRs, LLMs for extraction and even advanced chunking and retrieval techniques to find specific information in a variety of unstructured documents: invoices, large documents, heterogeneous documents, documents with tables, etc.. The orchestrator uses the results of these searches for a variety of tasks: calling APIs, applications, other agents, etc.
